# A/B Testing on Marketing Campaigns Data
## Overview  
This project analyzes the effectiveness of digital advertising campaigns using A/B testing methodologies. Leveraging a dataset of over **580,000 user records**, the analysis aims to determine whether the ad campaign led to a statistically significant increase in conversion rates compared to a PSA (control) group.

In addition to classical hypothesis testing, the project incorporates **bootstrap resampling**, **group sequential analysis**, and **multiple testing correction techniques** to account for interim data reviews and time-varying effects.

## üîç Key Findings  
- **Ad Group Conversion Rate**: 2.55%  
- **Control Group Conversion Rate**: 1.79%  
- **p-value**: < 0.001 (significant uplift in ad group)  
- **Effect strengthened after Day 2**, suggesting time-dependent ad impact  
- Pocock and Bonferroni boundaries used to control Type I error across repeated analyses
